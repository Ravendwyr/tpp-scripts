# tpp-scripts
A collection of scripts that do stuff with Twitch Plays Pok√©mon API.

***

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you must first checkout the repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/Ravendwyr/tpp-scripts.git

Then make sure the necessary libraries are installed.

    $ cd tpp-scripts
    $ npm install

These scripts have been built and tested with [Node 12](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/), however other versions may still work.

## tpp-getusers.js

Originally designed as a moderation aid, this script uses [tmi.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmi.js) and [node-twitch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-twitch) to query the Twitch API to download and save the userdata and profile pictures of ~~almost~~ everyone in the chosen channel's chat room.

User data is saved to `user_data/<username>.json` while their profile pictures are saved to `user_avatars/<username>-<filehash>.png`.  Saving user data is disabled by default but can be easily enabled by removing the comment blocks surrounding the code.

This tool requires an [OAuth token](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) as well as a Client ID and Secret Key from a [Twitch App](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) in order to work.  These keys need to be stored in the provided `.env` file prior to launching the script.

The script checks the APIs on inital boot as well as when a new message comes in or when a new user has joined the chat and doesn't stop until terminated.

    $ node tpp-getusers.js

***

## tpp-runstatus.js

This queries the TwitchPlaysPokemon API for any active runs and saves the current run status to `run_status/<run>-<timestamp>.json`.  If no run is active or if the API returns an error, the results are saved as `run_status/unspecified-<timestamp>.json` instead.  If the server itself returns an error (e.g. 404 Page Not Found) then no file will be saved.

The script checks the API once every 20 seconds and doesn't stop until terminated.

    $ node tpp-runstatus.js
