# tpp-scripts
My collection of scripts to aid moderation at Twitch Plays Pok√©mon.

***

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/) or newer.

2. Checkout the repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Ravendwyr/tpp-scripts.git
```

3. Install the necessary libraries.

```
$ cd tpp-scripts
$ npm install
```

4. Obtain an [oauth code](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/quick/ydwqNyIzGq) from Twitch.

    Some of these scripts require your [Twitch App](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)'s Client ID and a linked [oauth code](https://twitchtokengenerator.com) with `moderator:read:chatters` and `moderator:read:followers` permissions in order to access Twitch API endpoints, while others require your [first-party auth-key](chrome://settings/cookies/detail?site=twitch.tv) in order to access Twitch GraphQL.  These keys need to be stored in the provided `.env` file before use.

## tpp-botcheck.js

Originally designed as a moderation aid, this script uses Twitch's [Get Chatters endpoint](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-chatters) to scan for and detect bot accounts in the chosen channel's chat room.  The userlist is compared with a list of bots on [TwitchInsights](https://twitchinsights.net/bots) and [CommanderRoot](https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/blocklist_manager.php) and prints detected bot accounts into the terminal window.  Each account is only printed once to reduce spam.

This script also reads the included `botcheck-safe.txt` and `botcheck-marked.txt` to filter out duplicates and false positives from the output.

`botcheck-safe.txt` is intended to be a manually maintained list of false positives while `botcheck-marked.txt` is intended to be a manually maintained list of accounts marked as bots in the stream's database.  If the `--ignore-safe` flag is included in the command, the contents of `botcheck-safe.txt` will be ignored.  If the `--ignore-marked` flag is included, the contents of `botcheck-marked.txt` will be ignored.  It is not recommended nor necessary to use these flags as they have been left in for debugging purposes.

The script queries the endpoint once every 30 seconds and doesn't stop until terminated.

```
$ node tpp-botcheck
$ node tpp-botcheck --ignore-safe --ignore-marked
```

## tpp-inputcheck.js

This quick and dirty script uses [tmi.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmi.js) to connect to a channel and keeps track of how much time has passed between a user's messages.  By default the script monitors every user in chat but when names are included as arguments the script will only focus on the provided names.

The script checks every new message comes in and doesn't stop until terminated.

```
$ node tpp-inputcheck
$ node tpp-inputcheck name1 name2 name3 ...
```

***

## tpp-getusers.js

Originally designed as a moderation aid, this script uses [tmi.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmi.js) to query the Twitch API to download and save the userdata and profile pictures of ~~almost~~ everyone in the chosen channel's chat room.

User profile pictures are saved to `user_avatars/<username>-<filehash>.png`.

The script checks users on inital boot, when a new message comes in, or when a user joins or leaves the chat and doesn't stop until terminated.

```
$ node tpp-getusers
```

## tpp-chatarchive.js

Inspired by ~~and blatantly stolen from~~ [@tonywu7's chat archiver](https://github.com/tonywu7/doug-district-public-library/blob/master/util/chat-archiver-v0.1.js), this script will query Twitch's GraphQL for the provided user's entire chat history ~~since records began in late 2017~~ and will attempt to convert it into a human readable format for archival and moderation purposes, sorted chronologically with the most recent messages at the top.

Be warned that the more the user has spoken in chat, the longer it will take and the larger the output file will be.  For instance, a user with 400 messages will only take a few seconds to download a 23Kb file whereas a user with over 135,000 messages will take the best part of 15 minutes to download a 6,700Kb file.  Also note that historic name changes are not provided by Twitch and will not be reflected in the output.

This script runs once and will ~~eventually~~ save the user's chat history to `chat_data/<username>.txt` when it finishes.

```
$ node tpp-chatarchive name
```

***

## tpp-runstatus.js

This queries the TwitchPlaysPokemon API for any active runs and saves the current run status to `run_status/<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>-<runname>.json`.  If no run is active or if the API returns an error, then no file will be saved and the console window will explain why.

The script checks the API once every 20 seconds and doesn't stop until terminated.

```
$ node tpp-runstatus
```
